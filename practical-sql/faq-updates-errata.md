**Page 13: pgAdmin Dialog to Create Server**

The location of the pgAdmin dialog to add a server has changed. Now, in the object browser, right-click `Servers` and then click `Register` > `Server`. The remaining steps in the Note on page 13 are the same. (Formerly, the dialog was accessed by right-clicking `Servers` and selecting `Create` > `Server`.)

**Page 15, Figure 1-5: pgAdmin Query Tool**

Version 6.9 of pgAdmin, released in May 2022, introduced a redesigned Query Tool Layout. General  functionality is the same, but if you are using version 6.9 or later, you will see that some menu icons shown in the book at the top of the window are now placed atop the results grid.

**Pages 282, 288: Geometry Viewer Results Grid Icon**

Beginning with version 6.9 of pgAdmin, released in May 2022, the icon to launch the Geometry Viewer in the result column header was changed from an eye to a map (makes sense). On Page 282 and later in the book, I mention clicking the eye icon to launch the viewer. Now, instead, click the map icon.
