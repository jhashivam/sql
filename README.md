# What is SQL ?
SQL is the language we use to "talk" to our databases

# What are different types of database managemnet system ?

So for our application to be able to do things like update somebody's username in the database or edit

their profile photo or delete a user if they want to leave our application, whatever it is, there's

a database management system that allows us to interface with that database.

So it's just the code of the program that does the talking to our database for us.

So we talked to our database management system and it talks to the database.
